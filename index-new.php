                    <p>I wanted to take a minute to send you a quick note to thank you for your outstanding support to our school. Your generous contribution of deeply discounted limousine rides contributed significantly to our highly successful fundraising gala this year. Your drivers were extremely prompt, always arriving at or before the appointed hour. The vehicles were in immaculate condition, and the service and hospitality were all first class. We will definitely be using DC Livery for all future limousine and car service needs, and would highly recommend your service to anyone. </p>
